## Risk-based Modeling and Prediction
we focused on predicting the occurrence and impact of the second wave of the epidemic. Our analysis involved the application of the return level approach, which required selecting an optimal threshold for identifying extreme events and estimating accurate return level values. Here is a summary of our findings:
#### 1. Optimal Threshold Selection
* Choosing a plausible threshold value is crucial, as it affects the precision and bias of the return level estimate.
* Using different methods to determine the appropriate threshold value for our data.
* The following Figure displays the peak values selected for infections.

#### 3. Prediction of the Epidemic
* We projected the future spread, considering the significant increase in confirmed cases expected.
* The Gaussian model was employed to estimate the value and timing of the expected peak, using the logistic model to determine growth rates.
* The following Figure presents three different scenarios, illustrating the predicted number of cumulative cases and daily cases, with peak times.
